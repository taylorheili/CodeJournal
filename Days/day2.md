# What I Learned

## VendingMachine
Today i only worked on the VendingMachine, it has to be one of my favorite assignments weve done. throuughout the day i was met with alot of challenges but i over came them and felt very acomplished. it was a lot of work but i learned about the array length and the actul items in the array are different.
