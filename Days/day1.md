# What I Learned

## AWS
The IAM was pretty interesting, we made our users and also we made a demo one that we deleted for practice. Its used for AWS, IAM essentially just authenticates the person usuing AWS. MFA is just Multi Factor authentication almsot every company on the internet uses it because its almost a necesity in todays world. The Google authenticater was very easy to use and its kind of satisfyin to me. The Ec2 was us making a computer for a website that we can have if we want.
