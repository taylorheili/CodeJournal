# What i learned

The first part that launches is app delegate, that loads in options and configurations. Then its the scene delegate, saying its going to connect and enter the foreground. Then the view controller says its loaded and that its going to appear anf then it appears. When you close out it runs the view will disapear and disapears. When you go to the home screen the scene delegate starts again. They use alot of tenses like did and will and that says what has happened and what will happen.
