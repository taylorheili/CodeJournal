# What I learned

Today we worked on a NASA api, we used their pictures for our app but they were from a website instead of in our assets which was pretty cool. I really liked how you can switch cameras if you want to see a different view. Ive also always wondered how they did the loading rings and i found that out today and it was pretty simple.
