# What i Learned

Today we had a presentation about Solid, the single responsibility principle. It makes sense to me, always nice to have your code very organized. The assignment was pretty straight forward im sure ill be using it alot in the future. The rest of the day im goin to work on practice tests for my second certification in swift.
